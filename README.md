# Food-Order-App

https://reactfoodorderingapp.netlify.app/

n this React project I've created food ordering application where I've used some of React core concepts such as Context API and Hooks. For databases, I've used Firebase to get menu data and also to send data to database when order action is performed. Application is fully responsive and it is designed by me.
